# machine_learning_study
In this repository, I will place some programs i have written during my study on machine learning.
The main reference book is 《统计学习方法》by 李航, or other books or blog.    

table of contents:    
perception          -> the case of perception model forked by 20160223    
k_nearest_neighbors -> the case of knn forked by 20160301    
naive_bayes         -> the case of Naive Bayes forked by 20160303        
c4.5                -> the case of c4.5 decision tree forked by 20160312    
HMM                 -> the case of hidden Markov model forked by 20160320  
SVM                 -> perhaps the libsvm is better, will study future    
LogisticRegression  -> the case of the logistic regression algorithm of
stochastic gradient descent method    
AdaBoost            -> the case of the adaboost algorithm     
ftrl_proximal       -> ftrl proximal algorithm, a ref    
email_spam          -> a naive bayes algorithm used for email spam detection    
word2vec_comment    -> a comment in Chinese for word2vec
